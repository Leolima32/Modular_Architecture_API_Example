Modular Architecture API Example
================================

This project provides an example implementation of a modular architecture for building a RESTful API using Node.js.

Getting Started
---------------

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website ([https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)).

### Installing

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:

shellCopy code

`$ git clone https://github.com/Leolima32/Modular_Architecture_API_Example.git`

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

shellCopy code

`$ cd Modular_Architecture_API_Example`

3.  Install the required dependencies:

rubyCopy code

`$ npm install`

4.  Start the development server:

rubyCopy code

`$ npm start`

The API will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

Modular Architecture
--------------------

This project follows a modular architecture, where each feature or component of the API is separated into its own module. This makes it easy to maintain, test, and scale the API as needed.

Built With
----------

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
*   [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
